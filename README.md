## <p align="center">networking resources</p>

First, let's go over some VPC network review topics. Here's something that surprises a lot of people who are new to GCP. The Virtual Private Cloud networks that I defined have global scope. They can have subnets in any GCP region worldwide and subnets can span any of the zones that make up a region. You can also have resources in different zones on the same subnet

data storage and database options can be divided into groups several different ways. One way is by how the data is structured; relational, non-relational, etc. Another way is by usage. With some uses potentially a good fit for more than one option

## <p align="center">App Engine and Cloud Functions</p>

App Engine and Cloud Functions are GCP services you use when you don't want to maintain a special server yourself. 



We'll first talk about App Engine. Other two App Engine environments, standard and flexible. Standard is the simpler. It offers a simpler deployment experience in a flexible environment and finer-grained auto-scaling. Like the standard environment, it also offers a free daily usage quota for the use of some services. What's sinctive about the standard environment is that low utilization applications might be able to run at no charge.




## <p align="center">Containers</p>

kubectl get - list resources

kubectl describe - show detailed information about a resource

kubectl logs - print the logs from a container in a pod

kubectl exec - execute a command on a container in a pod

A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Multiple Pods can run on one Node.

Containers give you an invisible box around your code and its dependencies, with limited access to its own partition of the file system and hardware. It only requires a few system costs to create and starts as quickly as a process. All you need on each host is an OS kernel that supports containers in a container runtime
Links to resources mentioned in this module:

Kubernetes makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices and deploy roll-outs and rollbacks. Now, let's have a closer look at Kubernetes Engine clusters, and why you might want to deploy a containerized application using pods. At its highest level, Kubernetes is a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called the cluster.

The system is divided into a set of master components that run as the control plane and a set of nodes that run containers. In Kubernetes, a node represents a computing instinct like a machine. In Google Cloud, nodes are virtual machines running in Compute Engine. You can describe a set of applications and how they should interact with each other, and Kubernetes figures out how to make that happen. Then you deploy containers on nodes using a rapper on one or more containers called a pod. A pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes that you create or deploy. A pod represents a running process on your cluster as either a component of your application or an entire app. Generally, you only have one container per pod, but if you have multiple containers with a hard dependency, you can package them into a single pod in shared networking and storage. The pod provides a unique network IP and a set of ports for your containers, and options that govern how container should run. Containers inside a pod can communicate with one another using localhost and ports that remained fixed as they've started and stopped on different nodes. A deployment represents a group of replicas of the same pod and keeps the pods running even when nodes, they run on fail. It could represent a component of an application or an entire application. In this case, it's the engine X web server. To see the running engine X pods, run the command kubectl get pods.

</p>

This section focuses on two levels of data storage concerns. The first-level concerns dynamic data that will be used for powering applications' reports. You'll need to decide which type of database is the best to use when storing that data. The second level concerns more static data. Think of images and files here

Relational databases are the kind that most people are familiar with. These databases store information in structured columns and rows, and data is retrieved is the SQL. Examples of this type of database are Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner. The use cases for relational databases vary, but in general if you need information on drive and e-commerce site, or content management system, you may want to choose one of the more traditional relational database options

Certain types of financial data also required a stricter structure of a relational database because that structure helps maintain data integrity. Non-relational databases store data in a much less structured format which is sometimes referred to as a Documents. Because of the less rigid structuring of the data, the format of incoming data can be changed over time

Perhaps by adding additional information occasionally to newer records without affecting the integrity of any older data still using previous formats. Example of this type of database are Cloud Datastore and Cloud Bigtable. As you can see, Non-relational database use cases have some overlap with Relational database use cases. If you know you'll need to quickly iterate, or add a lot of features to a project, using a non-relational database can allow you to keep adding fields to support new features without having to rebuild the entire database each time.

If you expect to really heavy data traffic, Cloud Bigtable is engineered to handle that kind of load. Another type of database storage is the Object database, where data is stored as binary large objects or blobs. An example of this type of database is Cloud Storage. If your computing needs involves storing a lot of images or other binary media, Cloud Storage is a logical choice for your data storage needs. Finally, we have the option of using a Warehouse Scale Database BigQuery. BigQuery also uses a SQL, but it's built specifically to handle the huge loads that real time data streaming, analytics, and reporting can place on a database.

Cloud Storage let's you choose among four different types of storage classes. Regional, Multi-regional, Nearline, and Coldline. Here's one way to think about them. Multi-regional and Regional are for high-performance Object Storage. Nearline and Coldline are for backup and archival storage. Multi-regional storage is appropriate for storing frequently accessed data, Website content, interactive workloads, or data that's part of mobile and gaming applications. People use regional storage in contrast to store data close to their Compute Engine virtual Machines, or the Kubernetes Engine Clusters. This proximity gives better performance for data intensive computations

Good luck!
## <p align="center">GCP Marketplace</p>

GCP marketplace lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on GCP. Essentially, GCP marketplace offers production grade solutions from third-party vendors who have already created their own deployment configurations based on Deployment Manager. These solutions are built together with all of your projects GCP services. If you already have a license for a third party service, you might be able to use a Bring Your Own License solution. You can deploy a software package now and scale that deployment later when your applications require additional capacity. GCP even updates the images of these software packages to fix critical issues and vulnerabilities but doesn't update software that you have already deployed. You even get direct access to partner support.

 A LAMP stack consists of Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, and PHP

## <p align="center">Module Review</p>

In this module, we automated the deployment of Infrastructure using Deployment Manager and Terraform and launched the Infrastructure solutions using GCP marketplace. Now, you might say that going through all the effort to deploy a network, firewalls rule, and the two Virtual Machine instances doesn't convince you to use Deployment Manager or Terraform. That's true if you only need to create these resources once and don't foresee ever creating them again. However, for those of us who manage several resources and need to deploy, update, and destroy them in a repeatable way Infrastructure Automation tools like Deployment Manager and Terraform become essential.




## <p align="center">BigQuery</p>

BigQuery is GCP's serverless, highly scalable, and cost effective Cloud data warehouse. It's a petabyte scale data warehouse that allows for super-fast queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Because there's no infrastructure for you to manage, you can focus on uncovering meaningful insights using familiar SQL, without the need for the database administrator. BigQuery is used by all types of organizations, and there's a free usage tier to help you get started. For more information, see the links section of this video. You can access BigQuery by using the GCP console, by using the command line tool, or by making calls to the BigQuery REST API, using the variety of client libraries such as Java,.NET or Python. There are also several third-party tools that you can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data, or loading the data. Here's an example of a query on the table with over 100 billion rows. This query processes over 4.1 terabyte, but takes less than a minute to execute. The same query would take hours if not days through a serial execution.


## <p align="center">Cloud Dataproc</p>

Let's learn a little bit about Cloud Dataproc. Cloud Dataproc is a fast easy to use fully managed Cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler way. You only pay for the resources you use with per second billing. If you leverage preemptible instances in your cluster, you can reduce your costs even further. Without using Cloud Dataproc, it can take from five to 30 minutes to create Spark and Hadoop clusters On-premise or through other infrastructure as a service providers. Cloud Dataproc clusters are quick to start, scale, and shut down with each of these operations taking 90 seconds or less on average. This means you can spend less time waiting for clusters and more hands-on time working with your data. Cloud Dataproc has built-in integration with other GCP services such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Bigtable, Stackdriver Logging, and Stackdriver monitoring. This provides you with the complete data platform rather than just a Spark or Hadoop cluster. As a managed service, you can create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don't need them. With less time and money spent on administration, you can focus on your jobs and your data. If you're already using Spark, Hadoop, Pig or Hive you don't even need to learn new tools or API's is to use Cloud Dataproc. This makes it easy to move existing projects into Cloud Dataproc without redevelopment. Now, Cloud Dataproc and Cloud Dataflow can both be used for data processing, and there's overlap in their batch and streaming capabilities. So how do you decide which product is a better fit for your environment? But first ask yourself whether you have dependencies on specific tools or packages in the Apache Hadoop or Spark ecosystem. If that's the case, you'll obviously want to use Cloud Dataproc. If not, ask yourself whether you prefer a hands-on or DevOps approach to Operations or a hands-off or serverless approach. If you opt for the DevOps approach, you want to use Cloud Dataproc. Otherwise, use Cloud Dataflow.


In this module, we provided you with an overview of managed services for data processing in GCP, namely BigQuery Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataprep, and Cloud Dataproc. Managed services allow you to outsource a lot of the administrative and maintenance overhead to Google, so you can focus on your workloads instead of infrastructure. Speaking of Infrastructure, most of the services that we covered our serverless. Now, this doesn't mean that there aren't any actual servers processing your data. Serverless means that servers or compute engine instances are obfuscated so that you don't have to worry about the Infrastructure. Cloud Dataproc isn't a serverless service because you were able to view and manage the underlying master and worker instances.


## <p align="center">Deployment Manager</p>

Deployment Manager takes this one step further. Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of GCP resources for you. You just specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format and deploy your configuration. This deployment can be repeated over and over with consistent results and you can delete a whole deployment with one command or click.

 By definition, an auto mode network automatically creates a subnetwork in each region. Therefore, I am setting the auto-create subnetworks property to true. 

 Now there are other infrastructure automation tools in addition to Deployment Manager that you can use in GCP. You can also use Terraform, CHEF, Puppet, Ansible, or Packer. All of these tools allow you to treat your infrastructure like software, which helps you decrease costs, reduce risk, and deploy faster by capturing infrastructure as code.
 
 Lab Intro: Automating the Infrastructure of Networks Using Deployment Manager or Terraform

In this lab we're giving you two choices. You can deploy resources by using Deployment Manager or Terraform. Either way, you deploy an automotive network called my network with a firewall rule to allow HTTP, SSH, RDP, and ICMP traffic. You also deploy the VM instances shown in this network diagram. Again, you have the choice of deploying these resources with Deployment Manager or Terraform through two separate labs. You can complete either lab or even both.

## <p align="center">Week 2 Module Overview </p>

Deployment manager uses a system of highly structured templates and configuration files to document the infrastructure in an easily readable and understandable format. Deployment manager conceals the actual Cloud API calls. So you don't need to write code and can focus on the definition of the infrastructure. In this module, we cover how to use deployment manager to automate the deployment of infrastructure, and how to use GCP marketplace to launch infrastructure solutions.

## <p align="center">Week 1 : Module Review </p>

In this module, we looked at the different types of load balancers that are available in GCP along with the managed instance groups and auto-scaling. You will able to apply most of the covered services and concepts by working through the two labs of this module. We also discussed the criteria for choosing between the different load balancers and looked at a flowchart and summary table to help you pick the right load balancers. Remember, sometimes it's useful to combine an internal and external load balancer to support three tier web services.


## <p align="center"> Choosing a load balancer </p>

let me help you determine which load balancer best meets your need. One differentiator between the different GCP load balancers is the support for IPv6 clients. Only the HTTPS, SSL proxy, and TCP proxy load balancing services support IPV6 clients

![image](https://github.com/sanket9006/Google-Clooud-Coursera-Notes/blob/master/Capture.PNG)




## <p align="center"> Internal load balancing </p>
 Internal load balancing is a regional, private load balancing service for TCP and UDP based traffic. In other words, this load balancer enables you to run and scale your services behind a private load balancing IP address. This means that it is only accessible through the internal IP address of virtual machine instances that are in the same region. Therefore, use internal load balancing to configure an internal load balancing IP address, to act as the front end to your private backend instances.


GCP internal load balancing is not based on a device or a virtual machine instance. Instead, it is a software-defined, fully distributed load balancing solution. In the traditional proxy model of internal load balancing as shown on the left, you configure an internal IP address on a load balancing device or instances, and your client instance connects to this IP address. Traffic coming to the IP address is terminated at the load balancer, and the load balancer selects a backend to establish a new connection to. Essentially, there are two connections. One between the client and the load balancer, and the one between the load balancer and the backend. GCP internal load balancing distributes client instance requests to the backend using a different approach,

It uses lightweight load balancing built on top of Andromeda, Google's network virtualization stack, to provide software-defined load balancing that directly delivers the traffic from the client instance to a backend instance. To learn more about Andromeda



## <p align="center"> TCP proxy load balancing </p>

TCP proxy is a global load balancing service for unencrypted non-HTTP traffic. This load balancer terminates your customers TCP sessions at the load balancing layer, then forwards the traffic to your virtual machine instances using TCP or SSO

TCP proxy load balancing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for Client Traffic. Similar to SSL proxy load balancer, the TCP proxy load balancer provides intelligent routing and security patching


## <p align="center"> Overview of HTTP(S) load balancing </p>
HTTP requests are load balanced on port 80 or 8080, and HTTPS requests are load balanced on port 443.
he backend services contain a health check, session affinity, a timeout setting, and one or more backends. A health check pulls instances attached to the backend service at configured intervals. Instances that pass the health check are allowed to receive new requests. Unhealthy instances are not sent requests until they are healthy again. Normally, HTTPS load balancing uses a round robin algorithm to distribute requests among available instances.
             
             
  If there are no healthy instances, with available capacity in a given region, the load balancer instead sends the request to the next closest region with available capacity. Therefore, traffic from the EMEA user, could be forwarded to the US Central 1-a back-end, if the Europe West 1-d back-end does not have capacity, or has no healthy instances as determined by the health checker. This is referred to as cross-region load balancing.


An HTTP(S) load balancer has the same basic structure as the HTTP load balancer, but differs in the following ways. An HTTP(s) load balancer uses a target HTTPS proxy instead of a target HTTP proxy. An HTTPS load balancer requires at least one signed SSL certificate installed on the target HTTPS proxy for the load balancer. The client SSL session terminates at the load balancer. HTTPS load balancer support the QUIC transport layer protocol. QUIC is a transport layer protocol that allows faster client connection initiation, eliminates head of line blocking in multiplexed streams, and supports connection migration when a client's IP address changes


## <p align="center">  Managed Instance Groups</p>

A managed instance group is a collection of identical virtual machine instances that you control as a single entity using an instance template. You can easily update all the instances in the group by specifying a new template in a rolling update.

If an instance in the groups stops, crashes, or is deleted by an action other than the instance groups command, the managed instance group automatically recreates the instance so it can resume its processing tasks.

Regional managed instance groups are generally recommended over zonal managed instance groups because they allow you to spread the application load across multiple zones instead of confining your application to a single zone or you're having to manage multiple instance groups across different zones.

First, decide whether the instance group is going to be single or multi zoned and where those locations will be. Second, choose the ports that you are going to allow and load balance across. Third, select the instance template that you want to use. Fourth, decide whether you want to auto-scale and under what circumstances. Finally, consider creating a health check to determine which instances are healthy and should receive traffic. Essentially, you're still creating virtual machines, but you're applying more rules to that instance group.


Managed instance groups offer autoscaling capabilities that allow you to automatically add or remove instances from a managed instance group based on increase or decrease in load. Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increase in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resource is lower.

Another important configuration for a managed instance group and load balancer is a health check. A health check is very similar to an Uptime check in Stackdriver. You just define a protocol, port, and health criteria . Based on this configuration, GCP computes a health state for each instance.
